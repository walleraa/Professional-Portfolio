            <!-- <p>
                This personal portfolio is made entirely from scratch, with some borrowed code from another website I made (more info on that website <a href="#sketch">here</a>).

            <p>
                This personal portfolio is made entirely from scratch. The goal of this site is to help display my experience in software, as well as give me something to work on in my free time. This site is currently still under development, and it will evolve alongside my career far after I have deemed it "fininshed." While developing the website, I have kept in mind accessibility, using manual testing as well as validators such as WAVE and Axe DevTools to make it user-friendly for all.

            <h2>The_Elements</h2>
            <p>
                This is a small game I made over winter break. Made entirely from scratch, it uses JavaScript event listeners to trace key strokes to move the player around, altering the DOM to reflect this. It only has a handful of levels and is pretty rudimentary, but it was a blast to create the logic and math that goes into simple interactions like movement and collisions.

        <div class="project" id="sketch" tabindex="0">
            <h2>Etch-A-Sketch</h2>
            <p>
                This was something I made in my free time and later added to my final project for SI 339 as "extra features." It uses JavaScript to detect user input (either through buttons or keystrokes) and the HTML canvas element to draw said input. It also utilizes session storage to save a user's drawing as they browse other parts of the site.
